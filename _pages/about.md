Zhenge Jia is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at University of Notre Dame under the supervision of professor [Yiyu Shi](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html). He obtained his Ph.D. degrees from University of Pittsburgh in August 2022 under the supervision of professor [Jingtong Hu](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jthu/index.html). He obtained his B.S. degree (Honors) in Advanced Computing from Australian National University in December 2017 under the supervision of professor [Weifa Liang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~weliang/). His research interests include personalized deep learning in healthcare, e.g., patient-specific arrhythmia detection, and on-device deep learning in healthcare, e.g., on-device personalized deep learning based healthcare system.
His research outcomes:

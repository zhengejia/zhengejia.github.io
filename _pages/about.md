Zhenge Jia is currently a “Qilu Young Scholar” Professor at School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University.
Before joining SDU, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at University of Notre Dame from 2022 - 2024 (supervised by Prof. [Yiyu Shi](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html)). 
He obtained his Ph.D. degree from University of Pittsburgh in 2022 (supervised by Prof. [Jingtong Hu](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jthu/index.html)). 
He obtained his B.S. degree (Honors) in Advanced Computing from Australian National University in 2017 (supervised by Prof. [Weifa Liang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~weliang/)). 
His research interests are in on-device learning, TinyML and personalized deep learning.
